// Quasar SCSS (& Sass) Variables
// --------------------------------------------------
// IMPORTANT: This file must be located at 'src/css/quasar.variables.scss'
// Quasar CLI automatically detects this file at this specific path and
// imports it globally. The path cannot be customized or changed.
//
// To customize the look and feel of this app, you can override
// the Sass/SCSS variables found in Quasar's source Sass/SCSS files.

// Check documentation for full list of Quasar variables

// Your own variables (that are declared here) and Quasar's own
// ones will be available out of the box in your .vue/.scss/.sass files

// It's highly recommended to change the default colors
// to match your app's branding.
// Tip: Use the "Theme Builder" on Quasar's documentation website.
